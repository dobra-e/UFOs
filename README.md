# UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with UFO sightings data that allows users to filter the table based on specific criteria.

## How to Use
1. Access the UFO Sightings website.
2. Filter the data by one or more criteria using the text input boxes on the left. After inputing the criteria, hit 'Enter'.
3. The table will automatically filter to show relevant data.
4. Delete criteria and click outside the input box to see the unfiltered data or select "UFO Sightings" in the top left corner.

## Summary
### Drawback
One drawback is that user input needs to match the data exactly to correctly filter the table. For example, if a user enters "CA" to filter for the state of California, the table will return no results. Instead, the user needs to enter "ca". 

### Further Development
Additional development of the website could include:
* The ability to filter on multiple criteria within a category, for instance, filtering by two cities.
* Using dropdowns or multiple select boxes to filter instead of text input. This would allow users to see all available options opposed to trial and error when entering text.
